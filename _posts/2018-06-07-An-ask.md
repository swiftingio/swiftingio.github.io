Our dear friend and a founder of swifting.io - Micha≈Ç, had an accident two months ago. He had a bad luck and got hit by a car while waiting on a crossing for a green light. He was supposed to get married in the summer, however life had different plans for him.

After a few weeks-long coma and such an accident he had a severe brain injury. Now he demands an intensive rehabilitation to get back to his previous life. The therapy is intensive and expensive. His family and fianc√© are raising funds for his rehabilitation. We would like to kindly ask you to donate if you can.

We truly believe that we can raise the needed amount and it will help Micha≈Ç to recover, get back to sports and finally marry the woman he loves ‚ù§Ô∏è.

<h5>We help Micha≈Ç come back to his life from before the accident</h5>
At the best age, full of health, energy and the will to live. Micha≈Ç was supposed to marry Monika on July 21. He was head over heels in love preparing for this moment as meticulously as to the half-marathons and triathlons he competed in. Unfortunately ... he was in the wrong place at the wrong time. An ambulance riding to save life, as a result of the accident, rammed Micha≈Ç, taking away his health. The only chance to return to everyday functioning is high-cost rehabilitation - let's fight with him!

Micha≈Ç was waiting for the green light. Standing on the bike path, he was arranging the plan of preparations for the wedding in his head. It was the second day of spring, 4 months to D-day. Are all invitations already sent out? Have we not forgotten someone? The sound of the approaching ambulance distracted him - they were going to save someone's life, hopefully. Cars present at ≈ör√≥dka Roundabout in Pozna≈Ñ stopped. Some of them went sideways, making a rescue corridor. One did not stop. It hit the ambulance which was leaving the roundabout. As a result the ambulance hit the biker who was waiting for the green light...

One moment that changed everything. In a few days he planned to run his first marathon in life. He didn‚Äôt suppose that instead of this race, he would face an ultramarathon, for which he doesn‚Äôt receive medals, only something much more valuable - a chance to recover. Micha≈Ç loved physical activities. Exercises, swimming, cycling. Today he also has exercises... All on the bed, with the help of physiotherapists. In pain and helplessness.

It was a miracle that Micha≈Ç survived the accident. His life most likely was saved by his helmet. Deep cerebral trauma, damaged lungs, post-accidental coma and, surprisingly, no fractures. Doctors were preparing the family for the worst in the following hours. But Micha≈Ç is a fighter. An athlete who loves life, challenges and, above all, his fianc√©e. During the marriage vows, the promise of staying with the other person for better or for worse is made. They did not expect the trial to come much faster...

In April they were to get the wedding rings they had ordered. Micha≈Ç did not make it... Monika brought them to the hospital. They are engraved with the date "July 21, 2018". However, they will wait for him much longer... Instead of the honeymoon - intensive, long-lasting, HIGH-COST rehabilitation. Micha≈Ç will fight as long as he needs to. It is up to us and our help if he gets the chance.

About 3 weeks after the accident, he began to wake up from a coma. At the first neurological consultation the doctors diagnosed minimal awareness and contact. For a long time, the human brain will remain as complicated to medicine as the Enigma ciphers. We do not know if Micha≈Ç will ever get back to full fitness, but intense exercises bring amazing results. Today he is raising his right hand, nods, answering yes or no questions. He is at the beginning of the way...

<strong>#MichalWalcz</strong> - under this hashtag many people express their support for Micha≈Ç. A fianc√©e, family, friends, acquaintances and completely random people whose hearts have moved for him. Micha≈Ç knows that he is not alone with this. That a lot of good souls are waiting for news, for his healing. In addition to positive words, he also needs a lot of money to help him finance expensive rehabilitation. Together we can do it!
