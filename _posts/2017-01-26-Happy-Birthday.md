Today is 26th of January. Our blog was initiated on that day, exactly one year ago, with this [post](https://swifting.io/blog/2016/01/26/big-hi-to-the-world/?utm_source=swifting.io&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=blog%20post). At that time, we couldn't even imagine and wish things would have gone so well! You've visited our website **143 377** times from all over the world üåçüåèüåé!

If we hadn't spoken to [Chris Eidhof](https://twitter.com/chriseidhof?utm_source=swifting.io&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=blog%20post), who encouraged us to start the journey of blogging, we wouldn't have been writing and learning so many things. Thank you Chris!

And most of all, thank you very much ‚ù§Ô∏è, dear readers, for reading our posts, for your contributions, comments and help you've given us - you keep us going!
