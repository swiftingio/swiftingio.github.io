title: \#42 Review all the things!
excerpt:

Today we'd like to share a talk presented on May 14th at the [UIKonf](http://www.uikonf.com/speakers/#Maciej) conference in Berlin.

The world has gone crazy. It has made us extremely busy nowadays. Product owners want us to write code fast, to ship new features even faster. Because of that we don't have time for self-improvement.

We are programmers that may be great in their craft, that may write top notch source code, but we are also - humans. We make mistakes, all the time. We also want to become better people, better engineers. But how can we do that? Why should we review our work?

You know, I have a vision, where unit testing and code review are a standard, not an opt-in feature in iOS development. I've been fighting a lot to introduce them at my workplace. Let me tell you what things get reviewed in other industries and why it is so. Join the talk if you want to start code review practices at your company, but you don't know how to kick it off.
