Iâ€™m very happy to share with you my new application: **Singo**, for checking singing abilities.

[![IMAGE ALT TEXT HERE](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/swiftingio/blog/%2351-Singo/Images/AppStore.png)](https://itunes.apple.com/pl/app/singo/id1405579828?mt=8)

#### How does it work?

Application compares frequency of a voice with a pitch frequency defined in a sing test and then it visualizes the difference between them. Based on that, the app gives you an overall score on singing skill.

#### Main features

- Application detects your voice and compares it to the frequency of the original recording
- Application gives you visualised feedback about how far you were from the proper frequency
- Application calculates the score and gives you an overall result on your singing skills
- Application gives you the possibility to listen to your recording
- New singing tests every month!


#### Recommendations

- Best to use with headphones
- Try to sing songs in different keys

#### Specification

- Application supports three octaves from C3 (130,8 Hz) to C6 (1047 Hz)

#### Goal

The main goal of this application is to give easy access to anyone to test their singing abilities. Especially for those who donâ€™t have a musical background. Singo is not a next generation karaoke application. This application will tell you if you really can sing or not (like me ðŸ˜ƒ).

I hope that Singo will help you to discover your singing talent. In my case, despite not beeing vocally talented, Singo showed me how to be more aware of my voice. Now I sing much better then I used to (confirmed by a professional musician).

Interested more about the background of the application? Please visit [this website](https://swifting.io/blog/2017/08/07/45-can-you-sing-well/).

#### Donation

All money earned by from this application will be given to kids who's parents canâ€™t support them in their music passion. I will share with you all the news about spending the money on this website and also on Twitter.

#### Author

Iâ€™m a software developer. Iâ€™m passionate about music. I have been playing violin since 2013 and since I've been thinking about trying to connect my two passions: programming and music. I hope in the future to improve this application with new features based on your feedback.
