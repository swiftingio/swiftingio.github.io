#### iOS Conf SG
On October 20th 2017 Dominik and I were on a seek for the Yeti in Singapore! We tried to tap into Singlish and we presented on [iOS Conference in Singapore](http://iosconf.sg?utm_source=swifting.io&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=blog%20post) a topic about Location on iOS and our technique to find a snowboarder on a mountain slope mentioned in [article \#46](https://swifting.io/blog/2017/10/30/46-locating-a-snowboarder-on-a-slope/?utm_source=swifting.io&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=blog%20post).

Thanks to Michael Cheng and [Engineers.sg](https://engineers.sg/?utm_source=swifting.io&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=blog%20post) our talk was recorded and you can learn available techniques for obtaining a location on iOS.
